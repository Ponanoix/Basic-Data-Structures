# Basic-Data-Structures
I implemented four basic data structures:
- array
- two-way list
- binary heap
- Red-Black tree
All are designed to be dynamically adjustable. One can add, delete or search an item in them.

The program has two options:
- Start benchmarking from a specific command written in main.cpp and save results to a .csv file
- Load data from a .txt file to a chosen structure and make it freely adjustable.

The format of the .txt file is very simple:
[NUMBER OF ELEMENTS] [Element 1] [Element 2] [...]

for example:

4 11 13 7 9
